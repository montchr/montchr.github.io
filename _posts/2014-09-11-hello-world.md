Yes, hello. I've lived on the web for a long while – well at least most of my life. And yet I've never taken the trouble to publish a blog.

I'm a little late to the blogosphere, as some people might say. I wouldn't.

I foresee this site being primary focused around daily work and play problems and solutions to those problems – for those problems that have solutions. One day you might see me writing about some obscure problem I encounter involving Mac OS 9 emulation, another day you might see me write about why WordPress Multisite is hella annoying to work with, and another day... well, I'd rather not pretend to look too far into whatever future our future selves might share together.

Some potential future updates:

- Portfolio
- Photoblog
- Playlists

Anyway, whatever future we share, let's hope for a bright one! Seeya.

<3
