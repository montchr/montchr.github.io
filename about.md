I'm a Philadelphia-based web developer for [Billy Penn](http://billypenn.com/). I graduated in winter 2014 from the Journalism program at Temple University's School of Media and Communication.

I like jazz/electronic/experimental/ambient/noise music, Mac games from the 1990s, Skyrim, photography, and cats. I also walk places.
