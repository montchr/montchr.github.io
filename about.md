title: About

I'm a Philadelphia-based web developer for [Spirited Media](https://spiritedmedia.com/) and its publications [Billy Penn](https://billypenn.com/), [The Incline](https://theincline.com/), and [Denverite](https://www.denverite.com/). I graduated in winter 2014 from the Journalism program at Temple University's School of Media and Communication.

In my spare time I listen to and produce electronic/experimental/ambient/noise music. I also like video games from the 90s, Twin Peaks, photography, and cats. I also walk places with a camera and/or field recorder.
